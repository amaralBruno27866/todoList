// Objective: 
// Provide type support for the Vite environment in TypeScript.

// Why: 
// Vite uses specific configurations that need to be recognized by TypeScript to avoid type errors and improve the development experience.

// Result: 
// Allows TypeScript to recognize Vite-specific configurations and features, such as static file imports.

// How to implement: 
// This file is automatically generated or can be manually created with a reference to the "vite/client" type.
/// <reference types="vite/client" />

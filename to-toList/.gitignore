# Objective:
# Define files and directories that should be ignored by Git to avoid committing unnecessary or sensitive data.

# Why:
# Prevents large files, logs, build artifacts, and editor-specific configurations from being tracked in the repository.

# Result:
# Keeps the repository clean and focused on source code, reducing clutter and potential conflicts.

# How to implement:
# Place this file in the root of the project. Git will automatically respect the rules defined here.

# Logs: Ignore log files generated by the application or tools
logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
pnpm-debug.log*
lerna-debug.log*

# Dependencies: Ignore the node_modules directory and build artifacts
node_modules
dist
